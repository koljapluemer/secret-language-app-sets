# Secret Language App Sets - Backend

## Running Locally

Start the static file server with CORS enabled:

```bash
python3 serve.py
```

This serves files from the current directory at `http://localhost:8080/`.

## Usage

The server enables CORS headers to allow requests from local frontend development servers (e.g., Vite on port 5173).
